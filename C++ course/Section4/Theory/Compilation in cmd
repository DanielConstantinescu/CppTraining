In the case we have an Class.h file (the header/declaration), a Class.cpp file (the implementation) and a main.cpp file (main program) we compile
using these commands:


g++ -c Class.cpp            // First thing first we compile the class file(s)
g++ -c main.cpp             // Last thing compiled is the program with the main function in it.
g++ -o App main.o Class.o   // We create an executable linking together the main programm and the compiled classes
