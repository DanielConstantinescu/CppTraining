* Copy Constructor *
    - used to create copies of an object' state in another object
    - if not provided, compiler will synthezise in automatically
    - default implementation just copies the values
    - user-defined implementation required for pointer members

* Rule of 3 *
    ! This rules says that if a user implemented any of the following functions, it should implement all the other functions !
        - Destructor
        - Copy constructor
        - Copy assignment operator

!! Not implementing user defined operations can lead to memory leak or shallow copy
