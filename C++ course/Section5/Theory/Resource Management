# Resource Management #

* Some classes own a resource (pointer, file handle, socket etc)

* We have to decide the action in case objects of such classes are copied, moved or destroyed.
For example, in case of destruction, the resource must be released to avoid leaks.

* Similarly, on copy or move the resource must be handled accordingly.

# Rule of 5 #

* Rule of 5 is implemented for classes that own a resource.

* If a class has such semantics, we must provide a user-defined:
    - Destructor; (for example, we must make sure to release the resource)
    - Copy constructor; (for examample, we must make sure to allocate new memory first and then copy the data)
    - Copy assignment operator; (similar to copy ; will be discussed in operator overloading)
    - Move constructor; (for example, we must make sure to move the resource o the destination)
    - Move assignment operator;

* Used to ensure proper handling of such resources

# Rule of 0 #

* If a class does not have ownership semantics, then do not provide any user defined function from the rule of 5.

* The compiler will synthezise the necessary functions

!! Providin user-defined implementation of some functions will prevent the compiler from synthesizing others !!
