# Dynamic Arrays #

* Used trough the vector class provided by the standard library.

#include <vector>

* It is a class, so it can hold most of the types.

std::vector<int> data {1,2,3};

* It automatically manage resources

* push_back() -> add an element

data.push_back(4);

* size() -> returns the size
d
ata.size();

* Elements can be accessed and modified like normal arrays, using [<position>]

* Vectors are ranges so we can loop them like this:

for(auto x : data) {

}

* It is a container so we can use iterators and their methods (begin, end etc) like in the case of Initializer Lists.

* erase(<iterator>) -> deletes an element from a given position

* insert(<iterator>,<vaue>)  -> inserts the value at the given location
