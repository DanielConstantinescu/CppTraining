# C++ Literals #

* A literal is a fixed value that appears directly in the code.

* Some of the C++ literals can be modified through prefixes or suffixes.

Ex: 14u, 621l, 9.2f

# User-Defined literals #

* In c++ we can define our own suffixes

* Creating custom literals provides syntactic shortcuts and increase type safety

Temperature temp {82.5};       // Fahrenheit or celsius??
Temperature temp {82.5_F};     // Use custom literal to convert

* Syntax:

<return type> operator ""_<literal>(<arguments>)

- operator "" -> defines a iteral operator function

- <return type> -> can be any type, including void

- _<literal> -> always starts with _ followed by a name

- <arguments> -> can be integer, float, char or string

# IMPORTANT POINTS #

* Custom literals should begin with _ .

* You cannot redefine the meaning of built-in literal suffixes.

* Only following types can be suffixed to make a user-defined literal: unsigned long long, long double, const char *, char
