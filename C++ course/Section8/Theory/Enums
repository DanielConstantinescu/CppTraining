# Enumerated TYpe #

* A type created through enum keyword.

* CReated with restricted range of values, called symbolic constants or enumerators.

* Enumerators are internally represented as undefined integral types.

* Can implicitly convert to an integer but not the other way around.

* Default value starts from 0, but users can assign any value.

* Enumerators are defined in the scope in which they were defined.

enum Color{Red, Green, Blue};
Color c = Red;
c = 1;  // Compiler error, use static_cast to convert
int x = Green;  // x will contain 1

* class keyword allows us to create scoped enums

enum class Color{RED, GREEN, BLUE};

* To use scoped enumerators we need to refer them trough the whole name

Color::RED
Color::GREEN
Color::BLUE

* The default underline type for scoped enums is int but we can specify another type

enum class TrafficLight : char{RED, GREEN, YELLOW};
