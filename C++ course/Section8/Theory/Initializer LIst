# Initializer List #

* Used with #include <initializer_list>;

* We must specify the type:
std::initializer_list<int> data = {1,2,3,4};

* begin() and end() get the begining and the end iterators of an initializer list

* size() get the size of the list

* Provides access to its elements through iterators. To acces the value from the current iterator, we use *
Ex:
int i = value.begin();
*i

* Will be constructed automatically from a braced list of elements like {1, 2, 3, 4}
