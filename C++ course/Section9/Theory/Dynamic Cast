# Dynamic cast #

* Dynamic cast checks if the cast can be done. If it can, it will return a pointer cast to the child class. If not, it will return nullptr.

Ex:
    Checking *pChecking = dynamic_cast<Checking*>(pAccount);
    if (pChecking != nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Minimum balance: " << pChecking->GetMinimumBalance() << std::endl;
    }

* Dynamic cast also work on references, not pointers. In this case, if it fails, it will throw an exception.
