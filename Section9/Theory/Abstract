# Abstract Class #

* An abstract class has at least one pure virtual function.

* Can contain other members (dat, non-virtual functions etc).

* Cannot be instantiated, but can be used through a pointer or reference.

* Established a contract with a clients. It forces the child classes to provide implementation.

* Used for creating interfaces (an interface contains only pure virtual functions and no other members).

# Pure Virtual Function #

* Virtual function marked with = 0

Ex: virtual void Serialize(float version) = 0;

* Does not have an implementation (optional).

* Cannot be invoked (except by derived classes if defined).

* No entry in the vtable.

* Must be overridden by the derived classes. If not, the child classes will also become abstract classes.
