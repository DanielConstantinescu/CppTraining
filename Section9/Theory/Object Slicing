# Object Slicing #

* A situation in which the compiler deliberately removes some part of an object.

* Occurs when child class object is assigned to a concrete base class object.

* The size of a child class object may be more than its base.

* While assigning it to a base object, some part of the memory may get overwritten. This will lead to memory corruption.

* To prevent this, the compiler slices the child object, effectively removing the memory that contains its attributes.

* The object is then copied into the base object.
