### Access Modifiers ###

Example:

class Base {}
private:
    MemberA          // Inaccessible outside the class ; accessible only to the members of the class

public: 
    MemberB          // Accessible outside the class

protected:
    MemberC          // Accessible only to the class and the child classes.
};

### public ###

class Child : public Base {       // For public access modifier, all the members are inherited exactly how they are defined in the Base class
private:                          // Even if the MemberA was inherited, it will not be available in the Child class.
    MemberA                       // Class Child can use only MemberB and MemberC.  

public:
    MemberB

protected:
    MemberC
}


### private ###

class Child : private Base {       // For private access modifier, all the members are inherited as private
private:                           // What was private in the Base will not be accessible, but others will
    MemberA                        // In this case only MemberB and MemberC can be inherited

private:
    MemberB

private:
    MemberC
}

### protected ###

class Child : private Base {       // For protected access modifier, all protected and public members of the base are inherited as protected
private:                           // What was private in the Base will not be accessible, but others will
    MemberA                        // In this case only MemberB and MemberC can be inherited

protected:
    MemberB

protected:
    MemberC
}
