# Multiple Inheritance #

* C++ allows inheritance from more than one class simultaneously

* Known as multiple inheritance.

* Allows a class to reuse/override behaviours from multiple classes.

* Multiple inheritance can lead to diamond inheritance (when classes inherit from a common parent, forming a diamond shape).
