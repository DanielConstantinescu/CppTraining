### FACTORIES ###
#################

* A factory is a component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

### Motivation ###

* Object creation logic becomes too convulted

* Constructor is not descriptive
    - Name mandated by name of containing type;
    - Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names;
    - Can turn into 'optiml parameter hell';

* Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to:
    - A separate function (Factory Method);
    - That may exist in a separate class (Factory);
    - Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory;


### Factory Method ###

* A static method that creates objects.


### Factory ###

* A structure outside of the class that takes care of object creation.


### Inner Factory ###

* A factory that is not external, but resides inside the object as an inner class.


### Abstract Factory ###

* An abstract factory is used to create a hierarchy of factories that can be used to create related objects.
