### SINGLETON ###
#################

* A component which is instantiated only once.

### Motivation ###

* For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system:
    - Database repository;
    - Object factory;

* Situations hwere the constructor call is expensive
    - We only do it once;
    - We provide everyone with the same instance;

* Want to prevent anyone creating additional copies.

* Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety.

### Make a safe singleton ###

* Hide or delete the type's constructor, copy constructor and copy assignment operators.

* Create a static method that returns a reference to a static member.

* Guaranteed to be thread-safe since C++11.
