### Game Categorization ###

* Design Patterns are typically split into three categories:
    1) Creational Patterns
        - deal with the creation of objects
        - explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection etc)
        - wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

    2) Structural Patterns
        - concerned with the structure
        - many patterns which are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
        - stress the importance of good API design

    3) Behavioral Patterns
        - they are all different; no central theme
