### BUILDER ###
###############

### Motivation ###

* Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.

* Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.

* Having an object with many constructor arguments is not productive.

* Instead, opt for piecewise construction.

* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.

### Summary ###

* A builder is a separate component for buildin an  object.

* Can either give builder a construct or return via a static function.

* To make builder fluent, return this.

* Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class.
