### PROTOTYPE ###
#################

* The prototype is a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

### Motivation ###

* Complicated objects aren't designed from scratch.

* An existing design is a Prototype.

* We make a copy of the prototype and customize it.

* Requires "deep copy" support.

* We make the cloning convenient.

### Clone the prototype ###

* Implement your own deep copy functionality

OR

* Serialize and deserialize

* Customize the resulting instance
